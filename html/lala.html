    <h1>Hello world</h1>
    <p>I lost my sight when I was four years old by falling off a box car in a freight yard in Atlantic City and landing on my head. 
        Now I am thirty-two. 
        I can vaguely remember the brightness of sunshine and what red color is. 
        It would be wonderful to see again, but a calamity can do strange things to people.</p>

<div class="box2">
    <h1>Hello world</h1>
    <p>It occurred to me the other day that I might not have come to love life as I do if I hadn&rsquo;
        t been blind. I believe in life now. I am not so sure that I would have believed in it so deeply, otherwise.
         I don&rsquo;t mean that I would prefer to go without my eyes. 
        I simply mean that the loss of them made me appreciate the more what I had left.</p>

    <p>Life, I believe, asks a continuous series of adjustments to reality. 
       The more readily a person is able to make these adjustments, the more meaningful his own private world becomes. 
       The adjustment is never easy. I was bewildered and afraid. But I was lucky.
       My parents and my teachers saw something in me &mdash;a potential to live, you might call it &mdash;&mdash;which I didn&rsquo;t see, 
       and they made me want to fight it out with blindness.</p>
